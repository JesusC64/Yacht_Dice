YACHT DICE:

The following file a project that I created while I was studying MIPS assembly code.  The file consists of a game-like program that simulates a game that has a lot of the same rules as Yahtzee (rolling die, choosing to keep values and choosing a score at the end of the rolls),
however it takes some liberties in order to make sure the game wasn't too similar as well as managable on assembly registers.

Primarily, the game works using a random number generator for the die, using registers to hold values that are obtained on the die rolls, and having separate functions for each "score type" in the game.  The program also implements bonuses for reaching a certain score.

I have a demonstration of the game working in action at the link below:

Please feel free to take a look at this program and test it out yourself!
